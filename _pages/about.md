Hello! I'm a PhD candidate at the [Linguistics Department at the University of British Columbia](https://linguistics.ubc.ca). My dissertation looks into the contribution of voice similarity and perceived standardness in speech processing. Do we, as listeners, have an easier time processing speech that is (1) perceived as more standard and (2) in a voice similar to our own? How do we define stadardness and similarity?

My supervisor is [Molly Babel](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/profile/molly-babel/). My committee members are [Márton Sóskuthy](https://soskuthy.github.io/), [Jian Zhu](https://lingjzhu.github.io/) and [Alexis Black](https://audiospeech.ubc.ca/faculty-staff/academic-faculty/alexis-black/).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
