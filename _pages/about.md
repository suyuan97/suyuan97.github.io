Hello! I'm a PhD candidate at the [Linguistics Department at the University of British Columbia](https://linguistics.ubc.ca). My dissertation looks into the contribution of voice similarity and perceived standardness in speech processing. Do we have a easier time processing speech that is (1) perceived as more standard and (2) in a voice similar to our own? How do we define stadardness and similarity?

My supervisor is [Molly Babel](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/profile/molly-babel/). My committee members are [Márton Sóskuthy](https://soskuthy.github.io/), [Jian Zhu](https://lingjzhu.github.io/) and [Alexis Black](https://audiospeech.ubc.ca/faculty-staff/academic-faculty/alexis-black/).
