Hello! I'm a PhD candidate at the [Linguistics Department at the University of British Columbia](https://linguistics.ubc.ca). My research interests revolve around the relationship between speech perception and production. Specifically, I'm interested in the role one's own production plays in their perception of others.

My dissertation looks into the relative contribution of listener-talker similarity, prototypicality, standardness and articulator movements in speech processing. My supervisor is [Molly Babel](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/profile/molly-babel/). My committee members are [Márton Sóskuthy](https://soskuthy.github.io/), [Jian Zhu](https://lingjzhu.github.io/) and [Alexis Black](https://audiospeech.ubc.ca/faculty-staff/academic-faculty/alexis-black/).
