#### Teaching tools:

- [IPA UNO game (testing, please report any bug)](https://ipa-uno.onrender.com/): IPA UNO is a game I built to make learning IPA more fun — match sounds by features like place or manner of articulation, and play your way through the chart. It’s great for classroom use or just brushing up on your own!

- [IPA Generator](https://experiment.linguistics.ubc.ca/IPA_generator/): This tool was developed for students to practice producing a string of random IPA symbols. Users can choose the difficulty (Easy: all English sounds; Middle: half English and half non-English sounds; Hard: all non-English sounds) and randomly generate a CV/CVCV/CVCVCV sequence.
